Core mod for all of my mods

EnumPatcher code from [Slime Rancher Mod Loader](https://github.com/SlimeRancherModding/SRML), couldn't have done specific things in this mod without it.
Object optimization and animation system from [Catalyst](https://github.com/Reimnop/Catalyst).

Base mod includes:
- Debug features such as opening persistent data folder and app folder with configurable keybinds.
- Extra languages (verrry wip)
- Master and Animation difficulties added
- Catalyst optimization system that works in the editor (EditorManagement is recommended).
- Default themes prefixed with "PA "
- All themes now have 18 object color slots allowing for extra creativity. If you still want to use simplistic color themes, then just use whatever number of the slots you want (just know you'll be wasting data).
- Game Version number is 4.1.16 based on where the old version format was going
- Objects and Mod handlers
- Additions to background objects (new reactive channels, such as position, rotation and color, shade iterations and more)
- Custom QuickElements (animated text) system
- BeatmapObject keyframes with extra values (position now has Z axis and color now has opacity, hue, saturation and value)

Core mod for all of my mods

EnumPatcher code from [Slime Rancher Mod Loader](https://github.com/SlimeRancherModding/SRML), couldn't have done specific things in this mod without it.
Easing and keyframe system from [Catalyst](https://github.com/Reimnop/Catalyst).

Base mod includes:
- Debug features such as opening persistent data folder and app folder with configurable keybinds.
- Extra languages (verrry wip)
- Master and Animation difficulties added
- Instant keyframe fix
- Default themes prefixed with "PA "
- All themes now have 18 object color slots
- Game Version number is 4.1.16 based on where the old version system was going
- Objects and Mod handlers
- Custom QuickElements (animated text) system

1.8.6 > [Jan 8, 2024]
- Fixed Dynamic Homing Rotation flip axis bug, now the objects should properly loop around when the player moves around the object in a circle.
- Dynamic Homing keyframe Speed now lerps between keyframes.
- Fixed position keyframe using next homing's modified value.
- Static homing keyframes now properly lerp after a regular keyframe.

- Expanding and updating prefabs is now faster.
1.8.4 > [Jan 7, 2024]
- Fixed Shape loading issue when switching to arcade mode.

1.8.0 > [Jan 5, 2024]
- Added new feature: Homing Keyframes! Homing keyframes have two different types of homing:
Dynamic Homing - Always tracks the player at a delay. Includes min / max range detection and fleeing.
Static Homing - Targets the player once on keyframe activation.
Keep in mind homing is still early stage so it might not work the best in some ways, but they still work for the most part.
- Fixed a bug with DeepCopying prefabs not carrying over the BeatmapObject refeference for modifiers.
- Fixed a bug with setting eventRandomValues. If the value was higher than it was previously, it would set the regular eventValues to default.

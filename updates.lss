1.8.0 > Added new feature: Homing Keyframes! Homing keyframes have two different types of homing:
Dynamic Homing - Always tracks the player at a delay. Includes min / max range detection and fleeing.
Static Homing - Targets the player once on keyframe activation.
Keep in mind homing is still early stage so it might not work the best in some ways, but they still work for the most part.

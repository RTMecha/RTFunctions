- Fixed a bug with generating prefab objects that sometimes broke the game.
- Text updating now includes <themeObject=0>, <themeBGs=0>, <themeFX=0>, <themePlayers=0>, <themeBG>, <themeGUI> and <themeTail> formatting, so you can now have specific parts of a text object use a specific color while still allowing it to update the color.
1.9.3 > [Jan 23, 2024]
- Added position, scale and rotation offsets to objects, specifically for ObjectModifiers usage.
- Changed the way text objects update their text, fixing a bug with an ObjectModifiers modifier.
- Players that already exist now have their model updated when the model ID is changed.
1.9.2 > [Jan 22, 2024]

- Fully implemented Render Types (Foreground / Background), so objects can now be rendered in the 3D BG layer.
- Fixed a bug with Video BG that caused objects to double render in both FG and BG.
1.9.0 > [Jan 18, 2024]
- Reworked a ton of player data so it's more consistent with the other data.
- Video backgrounds are back! But only usable in the editor for now, since they were really annoying to implement. Though, I do plan on adding two new event keyframe types for this thing so you can animate it around lol

- Planning some more Beatmap Object features, such as Render Layer (Foreground & Background) and Object Tags.
- Added Zen Mode in Editor true or false for EditorManagement to set with its configs.
1.8.10 > [Jan 13, 2024]
- Added Tags to the internal data for Beatmap Objects. This will be used for ObjectModifiers and some editor stuff when I fully implement this.
- Added Autokill Type and Autokill Offset to Prefab Objects. Now you can have every object in a Prefab Object autokill at a specific time, assuming they're still alive then.
- Fully implemented Prefab Object speed, so every object becomes faster or slower depending on the speed you set. (This includes Start Time and every keyframe time)
1.8.9 > [Jan 11, 2024]
- Fixed a bug with Parent Additive Offset not being saved.
1.8.8 > [Jan 11, 2024]
- Fixed some errors with updating an object, like empty objects retaining internal objects and some issues with updating StartTime.

- Fixed a bug with different parent settings not carrying over when copying an object.
1.8.6 > [Jan 8, 2024]

- Fixed position keyframe using next homing's modified value.

- Expanding and updating prefabs is now faster.
1.8.4 > [Jan 7, 2024]
- Fixed Shape loading issue when switching to arcade mode.

- Added new feature: Homing Keyframes! Homing keyframes have two different types of homing:
Dynamic Homing - Always tracks the player at a delay. Includes min / max range detection and fleeing.
Static Homing - Targets the player once on keyframe activation.
Keep in mind homing is still early stage so it might not work the best in some ways, but they still work for the most part.
- Fixed a bug with DeepCopying prefabs not carrying over the BeatmapObject refeference for modifiers.
- Fixed a bug with setting eventRandomValues. If the value was higher than it was previously, it would set the regular eventValues to default.
